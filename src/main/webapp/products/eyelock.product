long-description=Instead of typing in usernames & passwords, the myris from eyeLock lets you cut through device security with just a look. It scans your eyes. When you look into the myris, it takes a video of the irises in your eyeballs, which it then uses as your personal identity code. No matching iris, and that device is not gonna work. Available this Spring with a price tag sub-$300.
