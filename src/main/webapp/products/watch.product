long-description=If you love cars, you know there are times when something just looks right. The brace of Webers on top of a Ferrari V12. The plaid-upholstered seats in a Mk.I GTI. Just the right stickers from just the right events lovingly placed on a roll bar. A watch isn't really any different when you consider the driver and what they drive. There's something about this Aevig Corvid Field Watch that's just right for the guy who loves sports cars but daily drives a gray market G-Wagen (or who fondly dreams about that very situation).
